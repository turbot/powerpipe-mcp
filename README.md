### Resources

The Powerpipe MCP provides access to the following resources:

- **status**
  - Represents the current state of the Powerpipe server
  - Properties include:
    - powerpipe_version: The current Powerpipe CLI version
    - server_version: The MCP server version
    - server_start_time: When the server was started
    - mod_location: Current working directory for mods

This resource enables AI tools to check and verify the Powerpipe environment state.

## Installation

### Prerequisites

- Node.js 18+
- npm or yarn
- Powerpipe CLI installed and configured

### Install from npm

```bash
npm install @turbot/powerpipe-mcp
```

### Configuration

Add to your `.mcpconfig.json`:

```json
{
  "powerpipe": {
    "name": "Powerpipe",
    "description": "Work with Powerpipe benchmarks and controls",
    "server": "github:turbot/powerpipe-mcp"
  }
}
```

You can optionally specify a working directory for your Powerpipe mods:

```json
{
  "powerpipe": {
    "name": "Powerpipe",
    "description": "Work with Powerpipe benchmarks and controls",
    "server": "github:turbot/powerpipe-mcp",
    "args": ["--mod-location", "/path/to/your/mods"]
  }
}
```

### Cursor Installation

To install the Powerpipe MCP server in Cursor:

1. Install the MCP plugin in Cursor

2. Add the following configuration:

```json
{
  "powerpipe": {
    "name": "Powerpipe",
    "description": "Work with Powerpipe benchmarks and controls",
    "server": "github:turbot/powerpipe-mcp"
  }
}
```

3. Restart Cursor

4. The Powerpipe MCP server will now be available in your Cursor environment.

## Usage

### Working Directory Configuration

The Powerpipe MCP server can be configured to work with mods in a specific location. There are several ways to set this:

1. Environment Variable:
```bash
POWERPIPE_MCP_MOD_LOCATION=/path/to/mods node dist/index.js
```

2. Command Line Argument:
```bash
node dist/index.js --mod-location /path/to/mods
```

3. Using the Configuration Tool:
```
Set the mod location to /path/to/mods
```

The mod location can be changed at any time during operation using the configuration tools.

### Best Practices

The Powerpipe MCP includes a pre-built `best_practices` prompt. Running it before running your own prompts will teach the LLM how to work most effectively with Powerpipe, including:

- How to work with benchmarks and controls
- How to interpret compliance results
- How to suggest remediation steps

### Example Prompts

Each prompt below is designed to work with Powerpipe's benchmarking capabilities:

```
Show me all controls that failed in the CIS AWS Benchmark.

List controls related to S3 bucket encryption.

What remediation steps are suggested for non-compliant IAM password policies?

Set the mod location to /path/to/my/custom/mods
```

### Writing Good Prompts

When writing prompts:

- Be specific about what compliance aspects you want to check
- Reference specific benchmarks or control categories
- Include context about your compliance requirements
- Specify the mod location if using custom mods

## Development

### Clone the Repository

```bash
git clone https://github.com/turbot/powerpipe-mcp.git
cd powerpipe-mcp
```

### Install Dependencies

```bash
npm install
```

### Build

```bash
npm run build
```

### Run

```bash
node dist/index.js
```

With custom mod location:
```bash
node dist/index.js --mod-location /path/to/mods
```

### Environment Variables

The following environment variables can be used to configure the MCP server:

- `POWERPIPE_MCP_MOD_LOCATION`: Set the working directory for Powerpipe mods (falls back to POWERPIPE_MOD_LOCATION if not set)
- `POWERPIPE_MCP_LOG_LEVEL`: Control MCP server logging verbosity with these values:
  - ERROR
  - WARN
  - INFO
  - DEBUG
  - TRACE
- `POWERPIPE_MCP_MEMORY_MAX_MB`: Maximum memory buffer size in megabytes (default: 100)

Example:
```bash
POWERPIPE_MCP_MOD_LOCATION=/path/to/mods POWERPIPE_MCP_LOG_LEVEL=DEBUG POWERPIPE_MCP_MEMORY_MAX_MB=200 node dist/index.js
```

Note: When using the Powerpipe CLI through the MCP server, the `POWERPIPE_MOD_LOCATION` environment variable is automatically set based on the MCP configuration.

### Local Development with Cursor

To use a local development version of the server with Cursor, update your `.mcpconfig.json` to use a local file path instead of the npm package:

```json
{
  "powerpipe": {
    "name": "Powerpipe",
    "description": "Work with Powerpipe benchmarks and controls",
    "command": "/absolute/path/to/dist/index.js"
  }
}
```

For example, if you cloned the repository to `~/src/powerpipe-mcp`, you would use `~/src/powerpipe-mcp/dist/index.js`.

### Testing

```bash
npm test
```

### Validate MCP Implementation

Use the MCP Inspector to validate the server implementation:

```bash
npx @modelcontextprotocol/inspector dist/index.js
```
