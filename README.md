### Resources

The Powerpipe MCP provides access to the following resources:

- **status**
  - Represents the current state of the Powerpipe server
  - Properties include:
    - powerpipe_version: The current Powerpipe CLI version
    - server_version: The MCP server version
    - server_start_time: When the server was started
    - mod_location: Current working directory for mods

This resource enables AI tools to check and verify the Powerpipe environment state.

## Installation

### Prerequisites

- [Node.js](https://nodejs.org/) v16 or higher (includes `npx`)
- [Powerpipe](https://powerpipe.io/downloads) installed and configured
- A directory containing your Powerpipe mod files (required)

### Claude Desktop

[How to use MCP servers with Claude Desktop â†’](https://modelcontextprotocol.io/quickstart/user)

Add the following configuration to the "mcpServers" section of your `claude_desktop_config.json`:

```json
{
  "mcpServers": {
    "powerpipe": {
      "command": "npx",
      "args": [
        "-y",
        "@turbot/powerpipe-mcp",
        "/path/to/your/mod/is/required"
      ]
    }
  }
}
```

The mod location argument is required and must point to a directory containing your Powerpipe mod files. This is where Powerpipe will look for benchmarks, controls, and other resources.

Save the configuration file and restart Claude Desktop for the changes to take effect.

### Cursor

Open your Cursor MCP configuration file at `~/.cursor/mcp.json` and add the following configuration to the "mcpServers" section:

```json
{
  "mcpServers": {
    "powerpipe": {
      "command": "npx",
      "args": [
        "-y",
        "@turbot/powerpipe-mcp",
        "/path/to/your/mod/is/required"
      ]
    }
  }
}
```

The mod location argument is required and must point to a directory containing your Powerpipe mod files. This is where Powerpipe will look for benchmarks, controls, and other resources.

Save the configuration file and restart Cursor for the changes to take effect.

### Direct Usage

To run the server directly:

```sh
npx @turbot/powerpipe-mcp /path/to/your/mod/is/required
```

The mod location argument is required and must point to a directory containing your Powerpipe mod files.

## Prompting Guide

First, run the `best_practices` prompt included in the MCP server to teach your LLM how best to work with Powerpipe. Then, ask anything!

Explore available compliance frameworks:
```
What benchmarks do we have available in Powerpipe?
```

Simple, specific questions work well:
```
Show me all controls related to S3 bucket encryption in the CIS AWS benchmark
```

Generate a compliance report:
```
What's our current compliance status for the NIST controls?
```

Dive into the details:
```
Find all failed controls in the AWS Security benchmark and explain why they failed
```

Get information about specific requirements:
```
Show me all controls related to password policies across our benchmarks
```

Explore with wide ranging questions:
```
Analyze our compliance gaps and suggest remediation steps
```

Remember to:
- Be specific about which benchmarks or frameworks you're interested in
- Mention the type of controls you want to analyze (encryption, access, networking, etc.)
- Start with simple queries before adding complex conditions
- Use natural language - the LLM will handle finding the right controls and benchmarks
- Be bold and open, it's amazing what insights the LLM will discover!

The LLM will:
- Choose the appropriate Powerpipe tools for your request
- Run benchmarks and controls as needed
- Format results in a clear, readable way
- Provide insights and remediation suggestions
- Help you understand compliance requirements and status

## Local Development

To set up the project for local development:

1. Clone the repository and navigate to the directory:
```sh
git clone https://github.com/turbot/powerpipe-mcp.git
cd powerpipe-mcp
```

2. Install dependencies:
```sh
npm install
```

3. Build the project:
```sh
npm run build
```

4. For development with auto-recompilation:
```sh
npm run watch
```

5. To run the server:
```sh
# Run with default mod location
node dist/index.js

# Run with custom mod location
node dist/index.js /path/to/your/mods
```

6. To test:
```sh
npm test
```

## Environment Variables

The following environment variables can be used to configure the Powerpipe MCP server:

- `POWERPIPE_MCP_MOD_LOCATION`: Set the mod location for Powerpipe
- `POWERPIPE_MCP_LOG_LEVEL`: Set the logging level (debug, info, warn, error)
- `POWERPIPE_MCP_PORT`: Set the server port (default: 7891)

## Development

### Clone the Repository

```bash
git clone https://github.com/turbot/powerpipe-mcp.git
cd powerpipe-mcp
```

### Install Dependencies

```bash
npm install
```

### Build

```bash
npm run build
```

### Run

```bash
node dist/index.js
```

With custom mod location:
```bash
node dist/index.js /path/to/your/mods
```

### Environment Variables

The following environment variables can be used to configure the MCP server:

- `POWERPIPE_MCP_MOD_LOCATION`: Set the working directory for Powerpipe mods (falls back to POWERPIPE_MOD_LOCATION if not set)
- `POWERPIPE_MCP_LOG_LEVEL`: Control MCP server logging verbosity with these values:
  - ERROR
  - WARN
  - INFO
  - DEBUG
  - TRACE
- `POWERPIPE_MCP_MEMORY_MAX_MB`: Maximum memory buffer size in megabytes (default: 100)

Example:
```bash
POWERPIPE_MCP_MOD_LOCATION=/path/to/mods POWERPIPE_MCP_LOG_LEVEL=DEBUG POWERPIPE_MCP_MEMORY_MAX_MB=200 node dist/index.js
```

Note: When using the Powerpipe CLI through the MCP server, the `POWERPIPE_MOD_LOCATION` environment variable is automatically set based on the MCP configuration.

### Local Development with Cursor

To use a local development version of the server with Cursor, update your `.mcpconfig.json` to use a local file path instead of the npm package:

```json
{
  "powerpipe": {
    "name": "Powerpipe",
    "description": "Work with Powerpipe benchmarks and controls",
    "command": "/absolute/path/to/dist/index.js"
  }
}
```

For example, if you cloned the repository to `~/src/powerpipe-mcp`, you would use `~/src/powerpipe-mcp/dist/index.js`.

### Testing

```bash
npm test
```

### Validate MCP Implementation

Use the MCP Inspector to validate the server implementation:

```bash
npx @modelcontextprotocol/inspector dist/index.js
```
